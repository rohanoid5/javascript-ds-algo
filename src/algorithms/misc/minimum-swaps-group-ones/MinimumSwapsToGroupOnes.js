/**
 * Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together
 * Given a binary array data, return the minimum
 * number of swaps required to group all 1â€™s present in the array together in any place in the array.
 *
 * Solution:
 * We will find out the total number of 1s available in the Array, say x
 * Now we will check each x sized subarray and find out the subarray which has the
 * maximum number of 1s. From that subarray the count of 0s will be the minimum number of
 * swaps required to group all the 1s together.
 *
 * An efficient way to solve this is to make use of Sliding Window
 * 1. Let's say totalCount is total number of 1s
 * 2. maxCount and currCount is set to 0
 * 3. We initialize windowStart and windowEnd
 * 4. We iterate over the array and increase currCount of 1s
 * 5. when window size i.e. windowEnd - windowStart + 1 === totalCount
 * 6. maxCount will be MAX(maxCount, currCount)
 * 7. We will decrease the window from start and decrease currCount if windowStart has 1
 * 8. Finally the difference between totalCount and maxCount will be the minimum swap required
