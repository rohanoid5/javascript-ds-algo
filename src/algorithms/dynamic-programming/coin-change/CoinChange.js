/**
 * Coin Change
 * Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
 * and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
 * how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.
 *
 * If we can create a state where Count(S, m, n) is the solution where S is the set of coins and
 * m is the mth coin and n is the number, we can create a recursive formula as
 * Count(S, m, n) = Count(S, m - 1, n) + Count(S, m, n - S[m])
